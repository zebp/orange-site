# Bindings

Bindings are interfaces to use resources that are provided to you by the [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers) platform that can be used in anywhere in your [Data Layer](/docs/data-layer) or [Route Actions](/docs/route-actions). A good mental model for bindings is to think of them as objects that you'd see on your `process.env` in Node.JS, except instead they're provided to you by accessing them as a property of `env` in your Orange project for any bindings configured in the `wrangler.jsonc` file.

## What do bindings look like?

Bindings look like standard JavaScript objects when you interact with them in your Orange project, but under the hood they're interfacing with your [Object Storage](), [KV Database](), or [SQLite Database]().

Lets look at an example, below is a route that acts as a file-upload page where we an `R2` bindings to store any uploaded files in object storage, and redirect them to a route where we show them page with a download button.

```jsx
import { Form, redirect } from "@orange-js/orange";

export async function action({ request, env }) {
  const form = await request.formData();
  const file = form.get("file") as File; // validation omitted for brevity.

  // Store the file in the storage bucket.
  await env.storageBucket.put(file.name, file.stream());

  // Redirect to a page where they can view information about the file.
  return redirect(`/uploads/${file.name}`);
}

export default function Upload() {
  return (
    <Form method="post" encType="multipart/form-data">
      <input type="file" name="file" />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

## What are some commonly used bindings?

While Cloudflare offers a wide variety of bindings, here are some of the most commonly used bindings in Orange and what they're used for:

| Binding      | Description                                                                |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `KV`         | Distributed KV store, commonly used for caching or authentication.         |
| `R2`         | Object storage similar to S3, commonly used for storing files.             |
| `D1`         | Strongly consistent SQL database, typically used a primary database.       |
| `Hyperdrive` | A connection pooler to Postgres databases hosted on other cloud providers. |
